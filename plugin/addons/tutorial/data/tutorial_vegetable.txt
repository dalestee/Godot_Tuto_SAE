In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Vegetable Ninja game, where players slice vegetables using their mouse.

Create the vegetable scene:
"Add a RigidBody2D", Scene
"Rename it 'Vegetable'", Scene
"Add a Sprite2D in the 'Vegetable' Node", Scene
"Add a CollisionShape2D in the 'Vegetable' Node", Scene
"Add an Area2D in the 'Vegetable' Node", Scene
"Add a CollisionShape2D as a child of the Area2D", Scene

Create the sliced vegetable pieces:
"Add a RigidBody2D", Scene
"Rename it 'SlicedVegetable'", Scene
"Add a Sprite2D in the 'SlicedVegetable' Node", Scene
"Add a CollisionShape2D in the 'SlicedVegetable' Node", Scene

Implement vegetable slicing logic:
"Attach a script to 'Vegetable' Node", Code
"Handle the slicing action and emit a signal when sliced", Code
"Instance 'SlicedVegetable' pieces upon slicing", Code
"Assign appropriate textures to the pieces based on the vegetable type", Code

Create the main game scene:
"Add a Node2D", Scene
"Rename it 'Main'", Scene
"Add a Timer and name it 'SpawnTimer'", Scene
"Add a Line2D for swipe trails", Scene
"Instance and position vegetables at random intervals", Code
"Handle player input to detect swipe gestures", Code

Add bombs:
"Duplicate the Vegetable scene and rename it 'Bomb'", Scene
"Change the texture to a bomb image", Scene
"Attach a script to the 'Bomb' Node", Code
"Handle the game-over logic when the bomb is sliced", Code

Implement scoring and UI:
"Create a CanvasLayer for UI", Scene
"Add a Label for the score display", Scene
"Update the score when vegetables are sliced", Code
"Display a game-over message when the game ends", Code

You're all set to create your Vegetable Ninja game!
